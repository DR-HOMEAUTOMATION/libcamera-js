# libcamera-js
A simple wrapper for [libcamera-apps](https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera-apps) (raspbian). Currently supports only libcamera-jpeg functionality, but the goal is to support all libcamera-apps functionality. 

## Installation
This library expects you to have already installed `libcamera-apps` 

### Install `libcamera-apps`
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get libcamera-apps
```

#### Enabling the pi camera
```
sudo raspi-config 
- Interface options
	- Disable Legacy Camera
- Advanced options
	- Enable GL Driver
	- Enable Glamor
```

### Import
After you have installed libcamera-apps and enabled the picam if necessary, test libcamera using `libcamera-hello`. You should see a window pop up displaying a preview of the camera. Once you know its working you can install the library using the command below: 

`npm install libcamera-js`

`const libcamera = require('libcamera-js')`

## API
Below is an example of how to use the module.
```js
const express = require('express')
const {JpegCam} = require('libcamera-js') // import the JpegCam module from `libcamera-js`

// Create the list of arguments to pass into the created JpegCam object
const CommandArgs = {
	'--width':480,
	'--height':480,
	'-o':'testFile.jpg',
	'-t':500,
	'-n':''
}

// instantiate a new JpegCam using the args we created
const myCam = new JpegCam(CommandArgs)

const router = express.Router()

router.get('/image', (req,res)=>{
/*
call `getNewImage` with a callback function that sends the file we specified 
in the args if the program got a new image and exited with code 0
*/
  myCam.getNewImage(code=>{ 
    if(code === 0){
      res.sendFile(`${process.cwd()}/${CommandArgs['-o'}`)
    }
  });
})
```

## JpegCam(options)

Constructor: returns a JpegCam object which can be used to take jpeg images using the [libcamera-jpeg](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#libcamera-jpeg) CLI tools

- `options` - JSON containing command line options:
  - `-o`: File Name - must end in jpg
  - `-t`: Integer - specify how long should be waited until the image is saved
  - `--width`: Integer - specify the width of the output image
  - `--height`: Integer - specify the height of the output image
  - `--shutter`: Integer(Î¼s) - specify a set light exposure in microseconds 
  - `--gain` : Integer - Specify a set gain

## getNewImage(close,err,data)

Method: takes a new image using the options passed into the constructor
- `close` - callback function that takes the exit code of the capture program, called when the command is finished
- `err` - callback function that takes the error message of the capture program, called when the command emits an error
- `data` - callback function that takes the stdout of the command, useful sometimes for debugging
